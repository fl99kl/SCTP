This project shows an example ready to use application to use ARM and DT on a heart disease dataset that can easily be used to compare both approaches.

This project contains four main files. First is preprocessing.py This one includes an exemplary implementation of all preprocessing steps. However you can also find many preprocessed examples as csv in this repository. ARM, CART and LGBM all refer to the respective algorithms and can all be used with multiple different parameters and the respective csv's.
