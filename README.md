# SCTP
This project shows an example ready-to-use application to use ARM and DT on a heart disease dataset that can easily be used to compare both approaches.

This project contains four main files. First is preprocessing.py This one includes an exemplary implementation of all preprocessing steps. However, you can also find many preprocessed examples as CSV in this repository. ARM, CART and LGBM all refer to the respective algorithms and can all be used with multiple different parameters and the respective CSVs. The CSVs used to produce the results shown in the paper are preprocesses_file_cleaned.csv and preprocessed_file_arm_cleaned.csv. All the Python files can be run on their own and include visualization steps.

An overview of the results with these preprocessing steps can be found in the result examples folder.
